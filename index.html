            1. Jigglypuff is a pink Pokemon with a spherical body.
             <br>
            2. It has pointed ears with black insides and large, blue eyes.
            <br>
            3. It has small, stubby arms and slightly longer feet.
            <br>
            4. On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur on the top of its head.
            <br>
            5. Its body is filled with air and, as seen in Pokémon Stadium, Jigglypuff can deflate until it is flat.
            <br>
            6. It is able to float by drawing extra air into its body, as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.
            <br>
            7. Jigglypuff uses its eyes to mesmerize opponents.
              <br>
            8. Once it achieves this, it will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing lullaby.
